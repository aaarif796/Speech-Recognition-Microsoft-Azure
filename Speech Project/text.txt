The happy kids played games in the park.
Today is sunny.
I like to draw colorful pictures.
The little girl is a great comedian.
We had a picnic and enjoyed yummy sandwiches.
The friendly dog wagged its tail and licked my hand.
The big yellow school bus picked up the students.
Mom baked a cake, and it smelled delightful.
The bright stars twinkle in the night sky.
